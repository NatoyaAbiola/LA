Congratulations on completing the first 12 Phases of Launch Academy Online! In this phase, you will focus on completing your final project, an app that will tie in everything you have learned in the program.  This article will give you an overview of what to expect.

### Learning Goals

* Learn what the capstone project is and what it entails.
* Discuss how to get started on working on your project.
* Understand the required workflow to complete the project.

### What is the Capstone Project?

Now that you have finished the core curriculum, it's time to complete your capstone project!  You'll build a fully functional application that serves as the cornerstone of your coding portfolio. This project will require all of the knowledge you have gained from the Launch Academy curriculum. This gives you a chance to demonstrate your knowledge to us, hiring companies, and most importantly, yourself.

There are a few notes and prerequisites we should cover before you begin with your capstone project. First of all, your project must be a Ruby on Rails app, because the end goal for the curriculum is to be able to develop a Rails app. The second requirement is that it must involve CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) functionality. This isn't necessary for every part of your app, and you are encouraged to build your app on top of these core functionalities. The purpose is to at least provide a base line for your app. The final, most important requirement is that your app should be something you are passionate or excited about. This will make working on the project feel much more meaningful and motivating! It will also share a bit about who you are and what excites you with prospective hiring managers.

### Getting Started on your Capstone Project

This phase has 3 important deliverables required before you start coding. Like most software projects, there's a certain amount of upfront planning that must be done so that you can focus on _building_ when the time comes.

In this phase, you will:

1. Brainstorm on 1-3 ideas for your capstone project
2. Create Entity Relation (ER) Diagrams
3. Write user stories and acceptance criteria

### Capstone Project Workflow

We'll be using a Git workflow during this project. What this entails is creating a new branch for each feature (or a group of relevant features). When you have finished writing tests and successfully implementing the feature, you can push your branch to Github and create a Pull Request. A PR will have all the files changed in your project.

From here, your PR will be reviewed your Senior Technical Instructor. This will give us a chance to review the work that you are doing and correct anything in the PR before being added to your master branch in your repository.

### Summary

* The Capstone Project is a Rails CRUD application on whatever you want
* The Project starts with ER Diagram and User Story creation
* We will use Git Workflow to review and accept work done on the Project
