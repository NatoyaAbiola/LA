Capstone Project Ideas

#SocialBird:

an app for my friends and family members stay connected to me from anywhere
it will act in a similar way to twitter

as a unauthorized user I can only see the root page with app description and links to sign in or create a new account.

a new user can see what the app is about or an existing one can sign it to use it

users should be able to register with the site and create short posts.

each user should be able to see their own posts plus the users they are following

users should be able to follow other users

#Acceptance Criteria:

I cannot see any of the other links/menus on the root page unless I am signed in
As a new user I want to create an account so that I can create a profile and use other features of the app

Acceptance Criteria:

I must specify a valid email address
I must specify a password, and confirm that password
If I do not perform the above, I get an error message
If I specify valid information, I register my account and I am authenticated
